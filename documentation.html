              So you’ve decided to use an API in your site. The next step is to
              familiarize yourself with the documentation. We will look through
              two examples of documentation and explain the important parts to
              get started using it. APIs and their documentation aren’t
              standardized, so you may have to search around to div out how
              to use it. In general, documentation should tell you:
               <ul>
                 <li>
                  Which technologies are used (JSON, XML)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  How to interact (usually a URL, variables, formatting, and examples)
                 </li>
                 <li>
                  What information is available
                 </li>
                 <li>
                   Usage limits or guidelines
                 </li>
               </ul>
            </p>
            <p class="card-text">
              The first example is
              <a href="https://www.openbrewerydb.org/">Open Brewery DB</a>. On
              the main page, it tells us that this is a free dataset.
              <div class='docImg rounded mx-auto p-3 m-3'>
                <img src='./assets/images/openbrewery1.png' alt='screenshot of text: about open brewery db is a free dataset and api with public information on breweries, cideries, brewpubs, and bottleshops' class="rounded img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
              </div>To get
                started, we’ll navigate to the documentation page. You’ll notice
                there isn’t much information here, only four links under the
                heading Endpoints.
              <div class='docImg rounded mx-auto p-3 m-3'>
                <img src='./assets/images/openbrewery2.png' alt='screenshot of text: documentation endpoints list breweries link get breweries link search breweries link autocomplete link' class="rounded img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
              </div> Let’s click the first link and see if we can
              find out more. Once there, we see a URL and an example output. The
              output looks a lot like a JavaScript object.
              <div class='docImg rounded mx-auto p-3 m-3'>
                <img src='./assets/images/openbrewery3.png' alt='screenshot of text: url to api and code for javascript object' class="rounded img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
              </div> This is a clue that
              we can interact with this API using JSON. Now that we’ve
              identified which technology we can use, let’s look at the URL. It
              starts with https, that tells us we’ll need to run our JavaScript
              query on a secure site to avoid issues with Mixed Content. After
              that it contains the typical subdomain “api”, the domain name is
              next, and following it is /breweries. So far, we’ve divd out
              which technology to use (JavaScript) and the URL we’ll need for
              our fetch method.
            </p>
            <p class="class-text">
              Scrolling down, we see headings with names like “by_[word]” and
              example URLs. There’s also a note letting us know that spaces can
              be replaced with underscores or “url encoding”.
              <div class='docImg rounded mx-auto p-3 m-3'>
                <img src='./assets/images/openbrewery4.png' alt='screenshot of text: keywords and url examples' class="rounded img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
              </div> Following the link takes us to a Wikipedia article describing how to replace spaces
              and other characters with stuff that works in a URL. We’ll ignore
              all that and take the easier route of replacing spaces with
              underscores (we are lazy developers after all). The rest of the
              page shows the different filters you can use when querying the
              information. Near the bottom, it also lets you know how to sort
              the incoming information.
            </p>
            <p class="class-text">
              Now that we’ve gotten all the information from that page, let’s
              check the other ones under documentation to see if there’s
              anything else we can learn. The Get Brewery and Search Brewery
              pages each give examples similar to the one we saw on the first
              page showing how a response for each of those queries would look.
              On the last documentation page, Autocomplete, we see that there’s
              a way to retrieve just the id and name of the brewery to use in an
              autocomplete feature. It also tells us that it will only return 15
              breweries.
              <div class='docImg rounded mx-auto p-3 m-3'>
                <img src='./assets/images/openbrewery5.png' alt='screenshot of text: Return a list of names and ids of breweries based on a search term. This endpoint is typically used for a drop-down selection. Notes: For the query parameter, you can use underscores or url encoding for spaces. The maximum number of breweries returned is 15. Below there is an example of expected return values' class="rounded img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
              </div>
            </p>
            <p class="class-text">
              That’s all the information from the documentation section. We were
              able to div out which technology to use (JSON), how to interact
              (URLs, search parameters), what information is available (the keys
              and values of the objects), but other than the Autocomplete
              section, we didn’t find any usage limits or guidelines. Let’s
              explore other parts of the site to see if the information is
              available. On the Frequently Asked Questions page, we find that
              the data is “100% free” and it’s only “for personal projects”. As
              we demonstrated, it can sometimes take searching around and
              deduction to get a full understanding of how to work with an API.
            </p>
            <p>
              Next, we’ll look at <a href='https://openweathermap.org/api'>OpenWeather’s API</a>. In contrast to Open Brewery, OpenWeather’s documentation is extensive. There are multiple types of APIs, each with their own documentation. There’s even a “How to Start” guide. In the summary under each API name, you can already determine which technologies are available, what information is available, and some usage limits or guidelines. That's 3 out of 4 things we need to know to get started!
              <div class='docImg rounded mx-auto p-3 m-3'>
                <img src='./assets/images/openweather1.png' alt='screenshot of text: shows a sections with different APIs and a short summary of them' class="rounded img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
               Let's click on the API doc for the One Call API. After a brief introduction, the last thing we need to know to get started, how to interact with the API, is thoroughly answered.
               <div class='docImg rounded mx-auto p-3 m-3'>
                <img src='./assets/images/openweather2.png' alt='screenshot of text: How to make an API call with a demo url' class="rounded img-fluid mx-auto d-block">
              </div>
            </p>
            <p>
              There are thousands of different APIs available to developers with a huge range in documentation quality. Hopefully these two examples give you an idea of how to get the information you need to make your API requests. If all else fails, you can usually find a way to contact the person or organization who created the API and get help directly. Now that you're familiar with how to read the documentation, head over to the <a href='./tutorial.html'>tutorial</a> to learn how to write the code.
