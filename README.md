# Server Side Station (S3)
Welcome to Server Side Station or S3, a site that provides additional insight on how server side APIs work.  We focus on documentation, acquiring authentication keys and miscellaneous data using the FETCH method, and how to manipulate the data received to be used by the user as they see fit.  We provide a tutorial and demo for better understanding.

## User Story
```
As a person aspiring to improve my software engineering skill set, I want to learn how to properly implement server side APIs so that I can use them for any future projects.
```

## Acceptance Criteria
```
Given I need help with getting data from a server side api
When I load the website
Then I am presented with information about what server side APIs are and have a nav bar showing different parts:documentation, tutorial, demo
When I click one of the links in the navigation
Then the UI navigates to that related page
When I view individual pages
Then I am provided information related specifically to that topic
```

## Learning Objectives

Given you are able to successfully navigate the site, you will gain knowledge in the following areas:

* Understand what server side APIs are and what their potential when coding

* Understand API documentation and how to navigate it to locate any authentication requirements

* Understand the steps necessary to FETCH data from an API site to implement it in your projects

* Design and deploy information obtain from an API
